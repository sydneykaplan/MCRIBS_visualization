.TH MINCLOOKUP 1

.SH NAME
minclookup - perform lookup table conversions on minc files

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B minclookup
[<options>] <in1>.mnc <out>.mnc

.SH DESCRIPTION 
.I Minclookup
will perform a lookup table operation on each voxel of a minc file. A
lookup table consists of a list of input values with matching output
values. Each voxel of the input file is found in the lookup table and
the corresponding output value is written out. These output values can
be either scalar or vector values so, for example, a colour lookup
table would have four columns: one column for input values and one
column for each of red, green and blue output values.

Lookup tables can take one of two forms: A continuous lookup table is
for treating voxel values as continuous (real) values and converting
values by doing interpolation between the values given in the lookup
table. A discrete lookup table treats input values as integers and
deals with them as completely independent entries, doing no
interpolation.

The most common use of continuous lookup tables is for converting
intensity values into RGB colours. To make the lookup tables simpler,
the input values are all rescaled into the range zero to one. By
default, the smallest value in the file maps to zero and the largest
maps to one. This value is then found in the lookup table, usually
between two entries in the table (the table is always sorted in
ascending order of input values). Linear interpolation is then done on
each output column and the resultant value (or values) is written to
the output file. If there is more than one output value per input
value, then the dimension vector_dimension is added to the output file
with length equal to the number of output columns in the lookup
table. For input values outside the range zero to one, the nearest
table value is used.

Discrete lookup tables are usually used for remapping label
values. Each input value is treated as an integer (it is not rescaled)
and if it is found in the lookup table, then the corresponding value
(or values) is written to the output file. If it is not found, then a
null value is written out (zero by default). No interpolation is done
with discrete lookup tables - to get a non-null output value, there
must be an entry in the table.

.SH OPTIONS
Note that options can be specified in abbreviated form (as long as
they are unique) and can be given anywhere on the command line.

.P
.I -verbose:
Print out progress information for each chunk of data copied (default).
.P
.I -quiet:
Do not print out progress information.
.P
.P
.I -buffer_size
<size>:
Specify the maximum size of the internal buffers (in kbytes). Default
is 10 MB.
.P
.I -filetype:
Create an output file with the same type as the first input file
(default).
.P
.I -byte:
Create an output file of type byte.
.P
.I -short:
Create an output file of type short.
.P
.I -int:
Create an output file of type int.
.P
.I -long:
Superseded by -int.
.P
.I -float:
Create an output file of type float.
.P
.I -double:
Create an output file of type double.
.P
.I -signed:
Create an output file with data stored in a signed type. This only
has an effect if the one of the -byte, -short or -long options is
specified.
.P
.I -unsigned:
Create an output file with data stored in an unsigned type. This only
has an effect if the one of the -byte, -short or -long options is
specified.
.P
.I -valid_range
<min> <max>:
Create an output file with integer data stored in the specified
valid range. This only has an effect if the one of the -byte, -short
or -long options is specified.

.SH Lookup table options
.P
.I -gray:
Use a gray lookup table to write out RGB values (default).
.P
.I -grey:
Synonym for -gray.
.P
.I -hotmetal:
Use a hot-metal lookup table to write out RGB values.
.P
.I -spectral:
Use a spectral (rainbow) lookup table to write out RGB values.
.P
.I -invert:
Invert the lookup table so that the maximum value maps to zero and the
minimum value maps to one.
.P
.I -noinvert:
Do not invert the lookup table --- the minimum maps to zero and the
maximum maps to one (default).
.P
.I -range
<min> <max>:
Specify the range of values that should map to the zero to one range
of the lookup table (default is the full range of the input file).
.P
.I -minimum
<min>:
Specify the minimum value that maps to zero in the lookup table.
.P
.I -maximum
<max>:
Specify the maximum value that maps to one in the lookup table.
.P
.I -lookup_table
<file|->:
Specify the name of a file containing the lookup table. If - is given,
then the lookup table is read from stdin. The file consists of at
least two columns. The first column gives the input values and the
other columns give the corresponding output values. For a continuous
lookup table, the first column should contain values between zero and
one inclusive (entries for both zero and one should usually be
given). For a discrete lookup table, the first column should contain
integer values. If more than one output column is given, then the
output file will have the dimension vector_dimension with a length
that matches the number of output columns. The lines of the table are
sorted so that the first column is in ascending order.
.P
.I -lut_string
<lookup table string>:
Specify the complete lookup table in a single string. The character
";" is used to separate lines.
.P
.I -continuous:
The lookup table is continuous (see description above): Input values
are treated as continuous (real) values and are rescaled to the range
zero to one before being looked up; interpolation is done between
values in the table. This is the default behaviour.
.P
.I -discrete:
The lookup table is discrete (see description above): Input values are
treated as integers and no interpolation is done between input values.
.P
.I -null_value:
Specify a null value to be used with discrete lookup tables when a
value is not found in the lookup table. This value must be specified
as a comma-separated list of values, with the same number of values as
output columns in the lookup table.

.SH Generic options for all commands:
.P
.I -help:
Print summary of command-line options and abort.

.SH EXAMPLES

To get hot-metal RGB images from an MRI file:

   minclookup -hotmetal input.mnc output.mnc

To convert the labels in a minc label file, use -discrete:

   minclookup -discrete -lookup_table lookupfile \\
      in_labels.mnc out_labels.mnc

where lookupfile is a file containing entries to map label 2 to 4 and
label 3 to 5:

   2 4
   3 5

You could also specify this lookup table on the command line:

   minclookup -discrete -lut_string '2 4;3 5' \\
      in_labels.mnc out_labels.mnc

To get a grey RGB file, with red for values less than the minimum and
green for values greater than the minimum, you can give two zero
entries and two one entries. The first zero is used for negative
values, the second zero is used for interpolation to the next
entry. There is no ambiguity about how to handle a value of exactly
zero because the first and last values of the table are handled in a
special way to make sure that they are treated as within range if
this sort of two-entry situation occurs.

   minclookup -lookup_table - input.mnc output.mnc <<EOF
   0 1 0 0
   0 0 0 0
   1 1 1 1
   1 0 1 0
   EOF


To invert a scalar image, you could use minclookup:

   minclookup -lut_string '0 1;1 0' in.mnc out.mnc
