.TH MINCHEADER 1

.SH NAME
mincheader - prints out header information for a minc file

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B mincheader
[-data] <infile>

.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Mincheader
prints out the header information for a minc file in cdl format (the
netCDF text format). Mincheader simply calls ncdump, writing out all
information except the image data. If the input file is compressed,
then its header is decompressed and only the header is printed. If the
.I -data
option is given, then the whole file is decompressed and all data
(except the image) is dumped.
