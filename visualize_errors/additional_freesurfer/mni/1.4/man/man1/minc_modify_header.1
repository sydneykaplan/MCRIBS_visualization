.TH MINC_MODIFY_HEADER 1

.SH NAME
minc_modify_header - modify the attributes in the header of a minc file

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B minc_modify_header
[<options>] <file>.mnc

.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Minc_modify_header
allows the modification, insertion or deletion of attributes in a minc
file. If possible, the file is modified in place, without copying the
data. This will happen when inserting (modifying) an attribute that
already exists and that ends up being the same length or shorter in
the new file. If an attribute is deleted or lengthened, then a complete
copy of the data is made, resulting in a completely new file that
replaces the original.

If the file is compressed, then it is first decompressed into a file
whose name is either the same as that of the original file up to the
".mnc" extension or the same minus the compression extension 
(".bz", ".bz2", ".gz", ".Z", ".z" or ".zip"). 
The new file will not be re-compressed.

Care is taken to completely overwrite any existing attribute when
inserting a new attribute so that information is guaranteed to be
removed from the file.

.SH OPTIONS
Note that options can be specified in abbreviated form (as long as
they are unique) and can be given anywhere on the command line.
.P
.I -sinsert
<var>:<attr>=<value> :
Insert a string attribute into the header. If the attribute does not
exist or the new string is longer than the existing one, then all data
in the file will be copied.
.P
.I -dinsert
<var>:<attr>=<value>(,...) :
Insert a double precision attribute into the header. If the attribute
does not exist or the new attribute is longer than the existing one,
then all data in the file will be copied. A comma-separated array of
values can be specified.
.P
.I -delete
<var>:<attr> :
Delete an attribute from the header. USE OF THIS OPTION WILL FORCE A
COMPLETE COPY OF ALL DATA TO BE MADE. Use "-sinsert" with an empty
string to delete information without copying data (the attribute will
continue to exist).
.P
.I -help:
Print summary of command-line options and abort.

.SH EXAMPLES:

To replace the patient name with an identifier string:

   minc_modify_header file.mnc \\
      -sinsert 'patient:full_name=C02-F0023'

To delete the patient name completely (forcing a copy of all data):

   minc_modify_header file.mnc \\
      -delete 'patient:full_name'

To hide the patient name without copying data, assuming that we know
that the attribute exists (the attribute will remain in the file, but
it will be empty):

   minc_modify_header file.mnc \\
      -sinsert 'patient:full_name='
