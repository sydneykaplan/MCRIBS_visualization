.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
\&\fI\s-1MNI:\s0:Spawn\fR can be seen as a glorified front end to Perl's \f(CW\*(C`system\*(C'\fR
(or, more accurately, to Perl's \f(CW\*(C`fork\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`exec\*(C'\fR); it's probably more
helpful, though, to think of it as a limited Unix shell accessed through
Perl rather than as an interactive program in its own right.  However
you think of it, its purpose is to execute other programs.  This comes
in very handy when writing programs that mainly run other programs and
process the output using Perl's built-in facilities\-\-\-i.e., glorified
shell scripts.  The reason I think of it as more shell-like is because
of the range of common tasks that \fI\s-1MNI:\s0:Spawn\fR takes out of your hands,
most particularly command logging, output redirection or capturing, and
error handling.
.PP
Here is a fairly complete list of \fI\s-1MNI:\s0:Spawn\fR's features:
.Ip "\(bu" 4
execution of a single command (the module's \fIraison d'etre\fR)
.Ip "\(bu" 4
execution through the \s-1UCSF\s0 Batch system (makes it possible to write
programs that run either sequentially or in parallel, depending on a
run-time option)
.Ip "\(bu" 4
representation of commands as a string or list\-\-\-like with Perl's \f(CW\*(C`system\*(C'\fR
and \f(CW\*(C`exec\*(C'\fR, the former might mean interpretation by the shell, but the
latter guarantees no shell involvement
.Ip "\(bu" 4
can search for programs when executing them, or look them up in a list of
\&\*(L"known\*(R" programs and their locations that is created (with your help)
before any programs are actually run
.Ip "\(bu" 4
maintains a list of default arguments for each \*(L"known\*(R" program that can be
inserted into the command line when the program is run
.Ip "\(bu" 4
can print a detailed summary of command execution (user, host, date, time,
and complete command line), to a file of your choice (normally your
standard output)
.Ip "\(bu" 4
redirection of the sub-process' standard output and/or standard error to
files (separately or together)
.Ip "\(bu" 4
capture of the sub-process' standard output and/or standard error to Perl
variables (separately or together) (redirection and capturing can be mixed
\&'n matched at will)
.Ip "\(bu" 4
merging of standard error with standard output
.Ip "\(bu" 4
customizable response to the child program crashing
.PP
The main features \fInot\fR presently in \fI\s-1MNI:\s0:Spawn\fR that I might someday
add are, in approximate order of how likely I am ever to add them:
.Ip "\(bu" 4
input redirection
.Ip "\(bu" 4
background execution
.Ip "\(bu" 4
remote execution (through \f(CW\*(C`rsh\*(C'\fR)
.Ip "\(bu" 4
pipelines
.PP
If you find the lack of any of these a problem, be sure to tell
me\-\-\-otherwise, I won't add them until \fII\fR find their lack to be a
problem!
.SH "INTERFACES"
.IX Header "INTERFACES"
\&\fI\s-1MNI:\s0:Spawn\fR comes with two complete interfaces, one object-oriented
(\s-1OO\s0) and the other a more conventional subroutine-based interface.  The
object-oriented interface is more general and flexible, but the
conventional interface is usually more convenient and will probably be
the more widely-used interface.  (This convenience arises from its use
of some hidden global state\-\-\-you don't have to carry around anything in
your code to use \fI\s-1MNI:\s0:Spawn\fR.  With the \s-1OO\s0 interface, you have to
carry around \*(L"spawning objects\*(R" that encapsulate the entire state of the
module; with the conventional interface, one particular \*(L"global\*(R"
spawning object is maintained by the module on your behalf for this
purpose.)
.PP
Thus, the conventional interface will be discussed first, and the bulk
of the documentation and example code will be in terms of it.  Note that
all of the subroutines in the conventional interface have corresponding
methods in the \s-1OO\s0 interface, and the correspondence is fairly obvious:
for instance, \f(CW\*(C`RegisterPrograms\*(C'\fR (subroutine) corresponds to
\&\f(CW\*(C`register_programs\*(C'\fR (method).  It's trivial to translate back and forth
between the two interfaces; for instance, this code (in the conventional
interface):
.PP
.Vb 4
\&   MNI::Spawn::SetOptions (verbose => 0);
\&   RegisterPrograms ([qw(mincresample mincreshape mincmath)]);
\&   AddDefaultArgs ('mincresample', '-quiet');
\&   Spawn (['mincresample', $invol, $outvol, @options]);
.Ve
would, in \s-1OO\s0 terms, be:
.PP
.Vb 5
\&   $spawner = new MNI::Spawn (verbose => 0);
\&     ...
\&   $spawner->register_programs ([qw(mincresample mincreshape mincmath)]);
\&   $spawner->add_default_args ('mincresample', '-quiet]);
\&   $spawner->spawn (['mincresample', $invol, $outvol, @options]);
.Ve
where, of course, the spawning object \f(CW\*(C`$spawn\*(C'\fR only has to be created
once in the course of your program's execution.
.PP
An important part of \fI\s-1MNI:\s0:Spawn\fR's interface is the set of \fIoptions\fR
which control almost every aspect of the module's operation, and make up
the bulk of the state that is carried around in \fI\s-1MNI:\s0:Spawn\fR objects
(variously called \fIspawners\fR or, for the darkly whimsical, \fIspawning
vats\fR).  One neat thing about these options is that they can be set either
semi-permanently with the \f(CW\*(C`SetOptions\*(C'\fR subroutine (or \f(CW\*(C`set_options\*(C'\fR
method), or on a temporary, per-execution basis.  This is convenient
because some options (like \f(CW\*(C`verbose\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`execute\*(C'\fR) will most likely be
set once, near the beginning of your program, and forgotten about; others
(like \f(CW\*(C`stdout\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`stderr\*(C'\fR, which control output redirection and
capturing) will\-\-\-if they are used at all\-\-\-usually be different with every
command you execute.  The module is designed so that doing things the
\&\*(L"normal\*(R" way is easy and convenient, but deviating a little bit
(e.g. always capturing standard error to the same variable, or changing
\&\f(CW\*(C`verbose\*(C'\fR frequently), is just as easy, and just requires a little more
typing on your part.  The module options are fully documented in
the section on "OPTIONS" below.
.SH "OPERATION"
.IX Header "OPERATION"
Regardless of which interface you choose to use, the operation of
\&\fI\s-1MNI:\s0:Spawn\fR is the same (hardly surprising given that the conventional
interface is implemented on top of the \s-1OO\s0 interface).  Generally
speaking, every program you write using \fI\s-1MNI:\s0:Spawn\fR will call the
\&\f(CW\*(C`Spawn\*(C'\fR subroutine (or \f(CW\*(C`spawn\*(C'\fR method) several times, and most
programs will make some use of \f(CW\*(C`SetOptions\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`RegisterPrograms\*(C'\fR, and
\&\f(CW\*(C`AddDefaultArgs\*(C'\fR.
.PP
\&\f(CW\*(C`Spawn\*(C'\fR is the call that actually executes a program; the others merely
change the state of the module to customize how programs are executed.
For instance, you might use \f(CW\*(C`SetOptions\*(C'\fR to turn off \f(CW\*(C`Spawn\*(C'\fR's
verbosity so it doesn't print each command as it is executed; or you
might use \f(CW\*(C`AddDefaultArgs\*(C'\fR to ensure that \f(CW\*(C`\-quiet\*(C'\fR appears on the
command line of certain programs whenever they are run.
.PP
The operation of the module is therefore best explained in terms of what
happens when you call \f(CW\*(C`Spawn\*(C'\fR.  Here we present a broad overview of the
procedure followed by \f(CW\*(C`Spawn\*(C'\fR\-\-\-more details (in particular, which
options govern each step and exactly how everything interacts) will come
in the following sections:
.Ip "\(bu command completion" 4
.IX Item "command completion"
This consists of turning a simple program name into a full path (unless
the program name you supply already includes a directory component), and
adding any default arguments for that program.  Each of these steps is
optional.
.Ip "\(bu plan redirection" 4
.IX Item "plan redirection"
Here we determine if the child process' standard output is to be left
untouched, redirected to a file, or captured to a variable; and whether
its standard error is to be left untouched, redirected to a file,
captured to a variable, or merged with its standard output.
.Ip "\(bu hand things over to \f(CW\*(C`batch\*(C'\fR, if appropriate" 4
.IX Item "hand things over to batch, if appropriate"
.Ip "\(bu fork" 4
.IX Item "fork"
.Ip "\(bu in child process: redirect and \f(CW\*(C`exec\*(C'\fR" 4
.IX Item "in child process: redirect and exec"
Either or both (or neither) of \f(CW\*(C`STDOUT\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`STDERR\*(C'\fR are redirected
(possibly to a pipe that is being read by the parent, for capturing
standard output), and the command to execute is \f(CW\*(C`exec\*(C'\fR'd.
.Ip "\(bu in parent process: harvest child and wait" 4
.IX Item "in parent process: harvest child and wait"
If we are to capture the child's standard output and/or standard error,
we read them in here.  Then, we wait for the child process to terminate.
.Ip "\(bu in parent process: react to child's termination status" 4
.IX Item "in parent process: react to child's termination status"
If the child program crashed (terminated with non-zero status), we react
in some user-customizable way.
.PP
Now that you have a rough idea of where all the module's options come
into play, we'll document those options.  Later on, we'll get into the
details of command completion, the \f(CW\*(C`batch\*(C'\fR interface, output
redirection and capturing, and error handling.
.PP
Throughout the following documentation (and interspersed example code),
it will help you to know that \f(CW\*(C`Spawn\*(C'\fR has one required argument (the
command to execute), and can take any number of option/value pairs.
These temporary options will override the global default options (or, if
you're using the object-oriented interface, the options in the spawning
object at hand) for the duration of that call to \f(CW\*(C`Spawn\*(C'\fR.  
.SH "COMMANDS, PROGRAMS, AND ARGUMENTS"
.IX Header "COMMANDS, PROGRAMS, AND ARGUMENTS"
A bit of terminology before embarking on the gory details: a \fIcommand\fR
is what you pass to \f(CW\*(C`Spawn\*(C'\fR for execution.  It consists of a \fIprogram\fR
and zero or more \f(CW\*(C`arguments\*(C'\fR.  By analogy with Perl's \f(CW\*(C`system\*(C'\fR and
\&\f(CW\*(C`exec\*(C'\fR functions, commands supplied to \f(CW\*(C`Spawn\*(C'\fR can be either strings
or lists (actually list refs, since the command has to be shoehorned
into a single scalar).  Since Perl's \f(CW\*(C`exec\*(C'\fR is ultimately used to
execute the command, the same provisos apply: if you use the list form,
you are guaranteed that no shell will meddle with your arguments, but
passing the command as a string means a shell might be involved.  This
is usually undesirable, both for efficiency reasons and because of the
danger of slipping into a morass of quoting if you have anything even
remotely exotic in your command.
.PP
For example,
.PP
.Vb 1
\&   Spawn ('ls *.t');
.Ve
will result in Perl passing your command string directly to \f(CW\*(C`/bin/sh\*(C'\fR,
which will then split and expand it (including expansion of the \f(CW\*(C`*.t\*(C'\fR
pattern), whereas
.PP
.Vb 1
\&   Spawn (['ls', '*.t']);
.Ve
will result in \f(CW\*(C`ls\*(C'\fR being \f(CW\*(C`exec\*(C'\fR'd directly by Perl with exactly one
argument, \f(CW\*(C`*.t\*(C'\fR (probably \fInot\fR what you want).  You might also be
tempted to take advantage of shell interpretation if you want to run
your output through a pipeline before getting your hands on it:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&   Spawn ('ls *.t | grep -v "^a"');
.Ve
(Note that quotes are already rearing their ugly head here, something that
should set alarm bells ringing in your head.  If it doesn't, you probably
haven't done enough shell programming\-\-\-lucky you!)
.PP
Or, you might want to run two commands in sequence, say to change
directories or impose some system limit temporarily:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&   Spawn ('cd /tmp ; ls *.blah');
.Ve
.Vb 1
\&   Spawn ('ulimit -f 4096 ; cat /dev/zero > zeros');
.Ve
The common thread here is that these all look like holdovers from a
shell script\-\-\-there is usually a more powerful, efficient, and
almost-as-succinct way to accomplish these things directly in Perl.  You
can do better pattern-based file searches using \f(CW\*(C`opendir\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`readdir\*(C'\fR,
and \f(CW\*(C`grep\*(C'\fR; most simple Unix pipeline tasks (especially those involving
use/abuse of \f(CW\*(C`grep\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`sed\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`awk\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`sort\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`cut\*(C'\fR, etc.) can be done
directly in Perl; you can change directories with \f(CW\*(C`chdir\*(C'\fR; and you can
even tweak system limits using the \fI\s-1BSD:\s0:Resource\fR module (available on
\&\s-1CPAN\s0).
.PP
In any case, the command-as-list paradigm is definitely safer and
preferable, but \f(CW\*(C`Spawn\*(C'\fR fully supports either method.
.PP
\&\f(CW\*(C`Spawn\*(C'\fR splits your command up into program and argument-list
components when it's doing command completion, which involves expanding
the program to a full path if appropriate, and possibly adding default
arguments (which depend on the program name) to the command.  See
the section on "COMMAND COMPLETION", below.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.IX Header "OPTIONS"
The actions of \fI\s-1MNI:\s0:Spawn\fR are mostly controlled through a set of
module options, which (if you're using the conventional interface) you
can think of as being sort of like global variables.  However, the
module carefully controls your access to the options\-\-\-they're
write-only, and your program will crash if you try to set an option
that's not really an option (because this is usually a typo in your
code).
.PP
In the conventional interface, there is one set of options that applies
to every call to \f(CW\*(C`Spawn\*(C'\fR.  These options can be changed
semi-permanently by calling \f(CW\*(C`SetOptions\*(C'\fR, or overridden on a temporary,
per-\f(CW\*(C`Spawn\*(C'\fR basis by adding optional arguments to the \f(CW\*(C`Spawn\*(C'\fR call.
(\*(L"Semi-permanent\*(R" just means that any options set with \f(CW\*(C`SetOptions\*(C'\fR
will stay the same until the next \f(CW\*(C`SetOptions\*(C'\fR call that updates that
option, or until temporarily overridden for one \f(CW\*(C`Spawn\*(C'\fR call.)
.PP
In the object-oriented interface, every spawning object carries around
its own set of options.  Thus, it's easy to have one \*(L"spawner\*(R" that runs
commands verbosely, and another that runs them quietly.  The
object-oriented interface has a method \f(CW\*(C`set_options\*(C'\fR (analogous to the
\&\f(CW\*(C`SetOptions\*(C'\fR subroutine), and for convenience you can also set options
when constructing a spawner with \f(CW\*(C`new\*(C'\fR.
.PP
For example, you might set the \f(CW\*(C`verbose\*(C'\fR option to \f(CW\*(C`0\*(C'\fR in the \*(L"global
default spawner\*(R" (the mechanism underlying the subroutine interface)
like this:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&   MNI::Spawn::SetOptions (verbose => 0);
.Ve
(Note that \f(CW\*(C`SetOptions\*(C'\fR is never exported from the module because of
its potentially ambiguous name.)  In the \s-1OO\s0 interface, you could create
a spawner and set its \f(CW\*(C`verbose\*(C'\fR option like this:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&   $spawner = new MNI::Spawn;
\&   $spawner->set_options (verbose => 0);
.Ve
or you could do them both at once:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&   $spawner = new MNI::Spawn (verbose => 0);
.Ve
Also, \f(CW\*(C`SetOptions\*(C'\fR (and \f(CW\*(C`set_options\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`new\*(C'\fR\-\-\-they are all
effectively the same here) can take any number of option/value pairs.
The important thing is that they be called with an even number of
arguments; using the \f(CW\*(C`=>\*(C'\fR operator helps you ensure that this is
the case:
.PP
.Vb 4

Finally, if it isn't obvious by now, each option name is a string of
lowercase letters and underscores; the value for each option is some
scalar value, which could of course be a reference to a list or hash or
any data structure.  The options and the nature of their values are as
follows:
.Ip "\f(CW\*(C`verbose\*(C'\fR (default: undefined)" 4
.IX Item "verbose (default: undefined)"
Boolean; if true \f(CW\*(C`Spawn\*(C'\fR will print a line summarizing each command and
its execution environment just before executing it.  This includes the
name of your program (taken from \f(CW\*(C`$main::ProgramName\*(C'\fR, usually supplied
by the \fI\s-1MNI:\s0:Startup\fR module); the user running the program, the host
on which it is run, and the directory from which it is run (supplied by
\&\f(CW\*(C`MNI::MiscUtilities::userstamp\*(C'\fR); the date and time of execution (from
\&\f(CW\*(C`MNI::MiscUtilities::timestamp\*(C'\fR); and the full path of the program
being run with all arguments.  The purpose of this summary line is to
answer \*(L"who, what, where, when, and how\*(R" for the execution of a given
command.  (Answering \*(L"why\*(R" is your job.)
.Sp
For example, if \f(CW\*(C`verbose\*(C'\fR is true, then the call
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&   Spawn ("ls");
.Ve
from a program called \f(CW\*(C`spawn.t\*(C'\fR might result in the following line
being printed just before the command is executed:
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&   [spawn.t] [greg@beelzebub:/home/greg/src/libperl/mnilib/t] \e

.Ve
(Yes, this is a rather ridiculous amount of information to provide.
Trust me, though\-\-\-at some point, when trying to trace the complicated
history of some data in the absence of other information, you'll be glad
to have it.)
.Sp
A useful peculiarity of \f(CW\*(C`verbose\*(C'\fR (and its close companion \f(CW\*(C`execute\*(C'\fR)
is that if it is undefined, it will take its value from the \f(CW\*(C`$Verbose\*(C'\fR
global in the calling package.  This ties in neatly with the global
variable \f(CW\*(C`$Verbose\*(C'\fR exported (presumably into package \f(CW\*(C`main\*(C'\fR) by
\&\fI\s-1MNI:\s0:Startup\fR; the fact that copying \f(CW\*(C`$main::Verbose\*(C'\fR to
\&\fI\s-1MNI:\s0:Spawn\fR's \f(CW\*(C`verbose\*(C'\fR option happens quite late (on every call to
\&\f(CW\*(C`Spawn\*(C'\fR, as long as \f(CW\*(C`verbose\*(C'\fR remains undefined in the spawning
object) means that you can change \f(CW\*(C`$Verbose\*(C'\fR anywhere in your main
program\-\-\-say, by tying it to a command-line option\-\-\-and have it
continue to affect \f(CW\*(C`Spawn\*(C'\fR's behaviour.  \f(CW\*(C`verbose\*(C'\fR is undefined by
default, so this feature will be used in almost every program you write
with \fI\s-1MNI:\s0:Spawn\fR.  Note that since the \fI\s-1MNI:\s0:Startup\fR module sets its
\&\f(CW\*(C`$Verbose\*(C'\fR to true, the \f(CW\*(C`verbose\*(C'\fR option (assuming you use
\&\fI\s-1MNI:\s0:Startup\fR and \fI\s-1MNI:\s0:Spawn\fR in concert) effectively defaults to
true.  However, you should keep in mind that this happens through a
little sleight-of-hand rather than in the obvious way.
.Sp
Also, the above explanation assumes that \f(CW\*(C`Spawn\*(C'\fR is being called from
the same package where you \f(CW\*(C`use MNI::Startup\*(C'\fR\-\-\-usually, \f(CW\*(C`main\*(C'\fR.  If
you call \f(CW\*(C`spawn\*(C'\fR from other packages, you should either set the
\&\f(CW\*(C`verbose\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`execute\*(C'\fR options explicitly, or arrange to \*(L"borrow\*(R" the
\&\f(CW\*(C`$Verbose\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`$Execute\*(C'\fR globals from \fI\s-1MNI:\s0:Startup\fR.  You can
actually make aliases to these variables in your module with the
following incantation:
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&   *Verbose = \e$MNI::Startup::Verbose;
\&   *Execute = \e$MNI::Startup::Execute;
.Ve
(see pp. 51\-52 of \fIProgramming Perl, 2nd ed.\fR for more information).
Then, when \f(CW\*(C`Spawn\*(C'\fR goes poking into your module for the value of its
\&\f(CW\*(C`$Verbose\*(C'\fR global, it will actually fetch the \f(CW\*(C`$Verbose\*(C'\fR global from
\&\fI\s-1MNI:\s0:Startup\fR\-\-\-which, due to \fI\s-1MNI:\s0:Startup\fR presumably exporting
\&\f(CW\*(C`$Verbose\*(C'\fR to \f(CW\*(C`main\*(C'\fR, will also be the value of \f(CW\*(C`$Verbose\*(C'\fR in your
main program.
.Ip "\f(CW\*(C`execute\*(C'\fR (default: undefined)" 4
.IX Item "execute (default: undefined)"
Boolean; if false \f(CW\*(C`Spawn\*(C'\fR will do everything up to (and including) the
\&\*(L"plan redirection\*(R" step.  It won't do any of the
fork/redirect/exec/gather/wait/react stuff, though.
.Sp
\&\f(CW\*(C`execute\*(C'\fR shares \f(CW\*(C`verbose\*(C'\fR's peculiar trait of taking its value from
\&\f(CW\*(C`$Execute\*(C'\fR in the calling package when it is undefined, which is also
the default value for \f(CW\*(C`execute\*(C'\fR.  And since \fI\s-1MNI:\s0:Startup\fR also sets
\&\f(CW\*(C`$main::Execute\*(C'\fR to true, \f(CW\*(C`execute\*(C'\fR also will usually (effectively)
default to true, but again through sleight-of-hand.
.Ip "\f(CW\*(C`strict\*(C'\fR (default: 1)" 4
.IX Item "strict (default: 1)"
Three-way flag; if it is \f(CW\*(C`1\*(C'\fR then \f(CW\*(C`Spawn\*(C'\fR will print a warning when
you try to run a program you haven't previously told it about (with
\&\f(CW\*(C`RegisterPrograms\*(C'\fR\-\-\-more about this below); if it is \f(CW\*(C`2\*(C'\fR, then
\&\f(CW\*(C`Spawn\*(C'\fR will \f(CW\*(C`die\*(C'\fR in such a situation.  If it is \f(CW\*(C`0\*(C'\fR (or indeed any
false value), \f(CW\*(C`Spawn\*(C'\fR will happily try to execute any program you wish.
(Note: this will only happen if you have given \f(CW\*(C`Spawn\*(C'\fR permission to go
poking around your command to fetch the program name, which is
controlled by the \f(CW\*(C`complete\*(C'\fR option.  In short, if \f(CW\*(C`complete\*(C'\fR is
false, then \f(CW\*(C`strict\*(C'\fR is ignored: no attempt is made to ensure that you
have \*(L"registered\*(R" the program ahead of time, and no \*(L"strictness\*(R"
warnings will be printed.)
.Sp
The \f(CW\*(C`strict\*(C'\fR flag also has another interpretation: when \f(CW\*(C`AddDefaultArgs\*(C'\fR
is called for an unknown program, a warning will be printed if \f(CW\*(C`strict\*(C'\fR is
any true value.
.Ip "\f(CW\*(C`complete\*(C'\fR (default: true)" 4
.IX Item "complete (default: true)"
Boolean; if true, \f(CW\*(C`Spawn\*(C'\fR will attempt to \*(L"complete\*(R" each command by
converting a bare program name to a full path and by adding default
arguments to the command.  (Each of these steps may be independently
controlled with the \f(CW\*(C`search\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`add_defaults\*(C'\fR options.)
.Ip "\f(CW\*(C`search\*(C'\fR (default: true)" 4
.IX Item "search (default: true)"
Boolean; if true, then \f(CW\*(C`Spawn\*(C'\fR might search a list of directories (see
the \f(CW\*(C`search_path\*(C'\fR option below) to determine the location of the
program it's about to execute.  This won't happen if \f(CW\*(C`Spawn\*(C'\fR already
has an idea of the program's location, either through a previous call to
\&\f(CW\*(C`RegisterPrograms\*(C'\fR (which is how you tell \f(CW\*(C`Spawn\*(C'\fR in advance what
programs you expect to be running) or if you supply a program name with
directory components (either absolute or relative).  Note that since
searching is a sub-task of completion, \f(CW\*(C`complete\*(C'\fR must be true for
\&\f(CW\*(C`search\*(C'\fR to have any effect.  Also, don't assume that just because
\&\f(CW\*(C`Spawn\*(C'\fR doesn't search a list of directories for your program, nobody
will\-\-\-Perl's \f(CW\*(C`exec\*(C'\fR calls either the shell or \f(CW\*(C`execvp(3)\*(C'\fR, which
means the \s-1PATH\s0 environment variable will ultimately be searched.
.Ip "\f(CW\*(C`add_defaults\*(C'\fR (default: true)" 4
.IX Item "add_defaults (default: true)"
Boolean; if true, then \f(CW\*(C`Spawn\*(C'\fR will actually add the default arguments
supplied with \f(CW\*(C`AddDefaultArgs\*(C'\fR to commands as appropriate.  Like
\&\f(CW\*(C`search\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`complete\*(C'\fR must be true for \f(CW\*(C`add_defaults\*(C'\fR to have any effect.
.Ip "\f(CW\*(C`search_path\*(C'\fR (default: undefined)" 4
.IX Item "search_path (default: undefined)"
String or list ref; supplies the list of directories to search when
searching for programs.  This is passed directly to
\&\f(CW\*(C`MNI::FileUtilities::find_programs\*(C'\fR, so the same rules apply as to the
\&\f(CW\*(C`$path\*(C'\fR parameter to that subroutine: \f(CW\*(C`search_path\*(C'\fR may be a string
containing a colon-separated list of directories or a reference to a
list of directories; or it can be undefined, in which case
\&\f(CW\*(C`$ENV{'PATH'}\*(C'\fR is used.
.Sp
\&\f(CW\*(C`search_path\*(C'\fR applies both to the implicit search done by \f(CW\*(C`Spawn\*(C'\fR when
it doesn't have any other information on the whereabouts of a program
(and \f(CW\*(C`complete\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`search\*(C'\fR are both true), and to the search

.IX Item "err_action (default: 'fatal')"
String; tells \f(CW\*(C`Spawn\*(C'\fR how to react when a child program crashes (has
non-zero termination status).  The most useful values are \f(CW\*(C`'fatal'\*(C'\fR,
\&\f(CW\*(C`'notify'\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`'warn'\*(C'\fR, and \f(CW\*(C`'ignore'\*(C'\fR; see the section on "ERROR HANDLING" below

.Ip "\f(CW\*(C`batch\*(C'\fR (default: false)" 4

.Ip "\f(CW\*(C`clobber\*(C'\fR (default: false)" 4
.IX Item "clobber (default: false)"
Boolean; if true, \f(CW\*(C`Spawn\*(C'\fR will overwrite files that are the
destination of output redirection.  \s-1NOTE:\s0 this option is ignored when
running through batch; the output redirection files will be appended
to if no Batch job is currently opened, or clobbered (overwriten) if
you already have opened a job (by means of \fIBatch::StartJob()\fR ).
.Ip "\f(CW\*(C`loghandle\*(C'\fR (default: \f(CW\*(C`\e*STDOUT\*(C'\fR)" 4
.IX Item "loghandle (default: *STDOUT)"
Glob ref or \f(CW\*(C`IO::Handle\*(C'\fR object or \f(CW\*(C`Filehandle\*(C'\fR object; if supplied,
specifies the filehandle to which \f(CW\*(C`Spawn\*(C'\fR will print the log lines
described under \f(CW\*(C`verbose\*(C'\fR.
.Ip "\f(CW\*(C`notify\*(C'\fR (default: \f(CW\*(C`$ENV{'USER'}\*(C'\fR)" 4

User to whom \f(CW\*(C`Spawn\*(C'\fR should send mail, if a command fails and
\&\f(CW\*(C`err_action\*(C'\fR is \f(CW\*(C`'notify'\*(C'\fR.  If false (eg. the empty string), then
mail is \fInot\fR sent (in spite of the value of \f(CW\*(C`err_action\*(C'\fR).
.Ip "\f(CW\*(C`stdout\*(C'\fR (default: undefined)" 4
.IX Item "stdout (default: undefined)"
Controls redirection/capture of the child program's standard output
stream.  If \f(CW\*(C`stdout\*(C'\fR is a string (i.e. not a reference), then it is
treated as a filename and the child's stdout is redirected to the named
file.  If \f(CW\*(C`stdout\*(C'\fR is a scalar or array reference, the child's stdout
will be captured (read through a pipe) to the referenced variable.  See
the section on "REDIRECTION AND CAPTURING", below, for full details.
.Ip "\f(CW\*(C`stderr\*(C'\fR (default: undefined)" 4
.IX Item "stderr (default: undefined)"
Controls redirection/capture of the child program's standard error
stream.  Everything about \f(CW\*(C`stdout\*(C'\fR holds for \f(CW\*(C`stderr\*(C'\fR\-\-\-it can be a
scalar or array ref to capture, or a string to redirect.  In addition,
in certain circumstances the child's stderr will be merged with its
stdout.  Again, see the section on "REDIRECTION AND CAPTURING" for full details.
.SH "COMMAND COMPLETION"
.IX Header "COMMAND COMPLETION"
Before doing anything else with your command, \f(CW\*(C`Spawn\*(C'\fR attempts to fill
in a few details about it.  This consists of converting a bare program
name to a full path and adding default arguments.  Command completion
can be completely disabled by setting the \f(CW\*(C`complete\*(C'\fR option to false.
.PP
In order to do either of these, \f(CW\*(C`Spawn\*(C'\fR must first split your command
up into \*(L"program\*(R" and \*(L"argument list\*(R".  If the command is represented as
a list, this is trivial: the first element of the list is the program,
and the other elements are the arguments.  If the command is represented
as a string, \f(CW\*(C`Spawn\*(C'\fR treats a leading sequence of non-whitespace
characters as the program, and the rest of the string as the argument
list.  This means that commands that are perfectly reasonable to a
shell, such as \f(CW\*(C`' ls *.foo'\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`'ls>log'\*(C'\fR are not properly
handled by \f(CW\*(C`Spawn\*(C'\fR (yet another reason to avoid the command-as-string
method).
.Sh "Expanding program name"
.IX Subsection "Expanding program name"
If the program name is \*(L"bare\*(R" (contains no slashes), then \f(CW\*(C`Spawn\*(C'\fR will
attempt to resolve it to a full path.  This is first done by looking up the
bare program name in an internal list of \*(L"known\*(R" programs (which you create
using \f(CW\*(C`RegisterPrograms\*(C'\fR).  (Keeping a list of known programs means
\&\f(CW\*(C`Spawn\*(C'\fR can help save you from silly typos as well as cache program
locations to avoid redundant multiple searches.)
.PP
If the program is not found in the list of known programs, \f(CW\*(C`Spawn\*(C'\fR
tries a little harder.  First, it might print a warning or even crash
(depending on the value of the \f(CW\*(C`strict\*(C'\fR option) because you're trying
to run a program that you didn't tell the module about ahead of time.
Then, as long as the \f(CW\*(C`search\*(C'\fR option is true, \f(CW\*(C`Spawn\*(C'\fR will search the
list of directories specified by the \f(CW\*(C`search_path\*(C'\fR option to find your
program.  If it still can't find it, then an error is
triggered\-\--\f(CW\*(C`Spawn\*(C'\fR actually acts as though the program had run but
failed with an exit status of 255 (this is the same thing Perl does when
you try to \f(CW\*(C`system\*(C'\fR a non-existent program), so its action depends on
the \f(CW\*(C`err_action\*(C'\fR option.
.PP
The result of a successful search is \fInot\fR saved anywhere\-\-\-so
repeatedly running the same program may result in repeated searches for
that program (another good reason to set up that \*(L"known program\*(R" list
with \f(CW\*(C`RegisterPrograms\*(C'\fR).
.PP
If the \f(CW\*(C`search\*(C'\fR option is false, don't assume that \f(CW\*(C`Spawn\*(C'\fR will just
run a program in the current directory (if it exists).  \f(CW\*(C`Spawn\*(C'\fR calls
Perl's \f(CW\*(C`exec\*(C'\fR function, which in turn either runs \f(CW\*(C`/bin/sh\*(C'\fR or calls
the C library function \f(CW\*(C`execvp()\*(C'\fR\-\-\-both of which will search for your
program if the supplied program name contains no slashes.  The
advantages of letting \f(CW\*(C`Spawn\*(C'\fR do the search are that the program's full
path appears in the command log, and that you can search a custom path
(different from the \s-1PATH\s0 environment variable).  If you explicitly want
to run a program in the current directory, just preface the program name
with \f(CW\*(C`'./'\*(C'\fR\-\-\-that way, no searching will be done.
.PP
Note that one consequence of the search algorithm used by \f(CW\*(C`Spawn\*(C'\fR (and
\&\f(CW\*(C`execvp(3)\*(C'\fR, for that matter) is that \f(CW\*(C`Spawn\*(C'\fR, unlike (say) the C
preprocessor or Perl's \f(CW\*(C`require\*(C'\fR function, will never search for
programs specified as relative paths.  Thus, if you try to 
\&\f(CW\*(C`Spawn ('../ls');\*(C'\fR, then the file \fIls\fR must exist (and be executable)
in the parent of the current directory when you call \f(CW\*(C`Spawn\*(C'\fR.
.Sh "Adding default arguments"
.IX Subsection "Adding default arguments"
In addition to maintaining a list of known programs, \fI\s-1MNI:\s0:Spawn\fR can
also keep track of a list of default arguments to add to the command
line for certain programs.  In fact, it maintains two such lists: one
for arguments to be inserted at the beginning of the command (\*(L"pre\*(R"
arguments), and another for arguments to be tacked on at the end (\*(L"post\*(R"
arguments).  Since this feature is most often used for specifying
program options, and since most Unix programs like their options to come
first on the command line, \fI\s-1MNI:\s0:Spawn\fR assumes that you mean \*(L"pre\*(R"
arguments if you don't explicitly say otherwise.
.PP
You can set the list of default arguments for a particular command with
\&\f(CW\*(C`AddDefaultArgs\*(C'\fR; for example,
.PP
.Vb 1
\&   AddDefaultArgs ('ls', '-1');
.Ve
will cause \f(CW\*(C`Spawn\*(C'\fR always to insert \f(CW\*(C`'\-1'\*(C'\fR at the beginning of the
argument list for any \f(CW\*(C`ls\*(C'\fR command.  \f(CW\*(C`AddDefaultArgs\*(C'\fR takes an
optional third string parameter which can be \f(CW\*(C`'pre'\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`'post'\*(C'\fR to
specify where in the command line this argument is to be added; it
defaults to \f(CW\*(C`'pre'\*(C'\fR.  Adding default arguments can be disabled by
setting the \f(CW\*(C`add_defaults\*(C'\fR option to false.
.PP
You can clear the default argument lists for a program with
\&\f(CW\*(C`ClearDefaultArgs\*(C'\fR.  \f(CW\*(C`AddDefaultArgs\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`ClearDefaultArgs\*(C'\fR are both
covered fully below, in the section on "CONVENTIONAL INTERFACE".
.SH "INTERFACE TO BATCH"
.IX Header "INTERFACE TO BATCH"
Not implemented yet.
.SH "REDIRECTION AND CAPTURING"
.IX Header "REDIRECTION AND CAPTURING"
The key to \fI\s-1MNI:\s0:Spawn\fR's claim to being more of a mini-shell than a
maxi-\f(CW\*(C`system\*(C'\fR call is its ability to redirect and/or capture the child
program's standard output and standard error.  This feature is
controlled through the \f(CW\*(C`stdout\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`stderr\*(C'\fR options.
.PP
As mentioned above, \f(CW\*(C`stdout\*(C'\fR can be a simple string (to redirect), or a
reference to a scalar or array variable (to capture).  Likewise,
\&\f(CW\*(C`stderr\*(C'\fR can be a string, a scalar or array reference, or one of two
special constants that override \f(CW\*(C`Spawn\*(C'\fR's default behaviour.
.PP
The child's stdout and stderr are handled (almost) independently, so you
can redirect and/or capture neither, either, or both of them as you
wish.  (See the section on "Special handling of stderr" below for the only exception
to this.)
.Sh "Redirection to a file (or filehandle)"
.IX Subsection "Redirection to a file (or filehandle)"
If either \f(CW\*(C`stdout\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`stderr\*(C'\fR is a simple string, that string will be
treated as a filename and the corresponding stream in the child process
will be redirected to that file.  Normally, you can leave it at that and
let \f(CW\*(C`Spawn\*(C'\fR decide\-\-\-using its \f(CW\*(C`clobber\*(C'\fR option\-\-\-whether the file in
question should be clobbered or appended to.  That is, you supply a bare
filename, and \f(CW\*(C`Spawn\*(C'\fR will prepend either \f(CW\*(C`'>'\*(C'\fR (to clobber) or
\&\f(CW\*(C`'>>'\*(C'\fR (to append), and use the resulting string as the second
parameter to \f(CW\*(C`open\*(C'\fR.
.PP
However, if your string already starts with \f(CW\*(C`'>'\*(C'\fR, then \f(CW\*(C`Spawn\*(C'\fR
leaves it alone, allowing you to choose whether to clobber or append
regardless of \f(CW\*(C`Spawn\*(C'\fR's \f(CW\*(C`clobber\*(C'\fR option.  To clarify:
.PP
.Vb 5
\&   Spawn ($cmd, stdout => "log");                 # maybe clobber, maybe append
\&   Spawn ($cmd, stdout => "log", clobber => 1);   # always clobber
\&   Spawn ($cmd, stdout => "log", clobber => 0);   # always append
\&   Spawn ($cmd, stdout => ">log");                # always clobber
\&   Spawn ($cmd, stdout => ">>log");               # always append
.Ve
Assiduous readers of the Perl documentation will note that \f(CW\*(C`open\*(C'\fR lets
you \*(L"open\*(R" more than just a filename: you can also redirect your child
program's standard error or standard output to an already-open
filehandle.  If you're doing it yourself, this is as simple as:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&   open (LOG, ">log") || die "couldn't create log: $!\en";
\&   open (STDOUT, ">&LOG") || die "couldn't redirect stdout: $!\en";
.Ve
When you're trying to persuade \f(CW\*(C`Spawn\*(C'\fR to do this for you, it's a tad
more involved.  First, since \f(CW\*(C`Spawn\*(C'\fR lives in a different package from
your filehandle, you have to specify the filehandle's package.  Also,
while\-\-\-according to the above rules\-\-\-you could get away with supplying
\&\f(CW\*(C`'&LOG'\*(C'\fR as the \*(L"filename\*(R" and letting \f(CW\*(C`Spawn\*(C'\fR prepend \f(CW\*(C`'>'\*(C'\fR or
\&\f(CW\*(C`'>>'\*(C'\fR as appropriate, this is not recommended.  According to
the Perl documentation, the modes used for the two open statements
(one to open the actual file, one to duplicate the filehandle) should be
the same.  Since \f(CW\*(C`Spawn\*(C'\fR doesn't know how you originally opened your
file, you should supply the open mode (\f(CW\*(C`'>'\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`'>>'\*(C'\fR).
Finally, to make things a little more predictable, it's a good idea to
put your filehandle into autoflush mode.
.PP
For example:
.PP
.Vb 5
\&   use FileHandle;
\&     ...
\&   open (LOG, ">log") || die "couldn't create log: $!\en";
\&   LOG->autoflush;
\&   Spawn ($cmd, stdout => ">&main::LOG");
.Ve
.Sh "Capture to a variable"
.IX Subsection "Capture to a variable"
If \f(CW\*(C`stdout\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`stderr\*(C'\fR is a reference to a scalar or array variable,
the corresponding stream will be \*(L"captured\*(R" by \f(CW\*(C`Spawn\*(C'\fR and put into the
referenced variable.  Capturing to a scalar will result in all of the
child's output lines being concatenated with newlines preserved;
capturing to an array means that one output line will go to each element
of the array with newlines removed.
.Sh "Special handling of stderr"
.IX Subsection "Special handling of stderr"
If you don't otherwise specify what to do with the child's standard
error (i.e., the \f(CW\*(C`stderr\*(C'\fR option is undefined), \fIand\fR you are
redirecting stdout, then \f(CW\*(C`Spawn\*(C'\fR will automatically merge the child's
stderr into its stdout.  (That is, it will redirect stderr to
\&\f(CW\*(C`'&STDOUT'\*(C'\fR.)  This is usually desirable; if you're going to the
trouble to keep a program's output, you probably want to keep its error
messages in the same place.  You can easily override this by redirecting
or capturing stderr separately; for example,
.PP
.Vb 1
\&   Spawn (['ls', @files], stdout => 'ls.log');
.Ve
would put the child's stdout and stderr both in \fIls.log\fR, whereas
.PP
.Vb 1
\&   Spawn (['ls', @files], stdout => 'ls.log', stderr => 'ls.err');
.Ve
would redirect them separately, and
.PP
.Vb 1
\&   Spawn (['ls', @files], stdout => 'ls.log', stderr => \e$errors);
.Ve
would redirect stdout and capture stderr to the \f(CW\*(C`$errors\*(C'\fR variable.
.PP
If you want to leave the child's stderr explicitly untouched,
\&\fI\s-1MNI:\s0:Spawn\fR provides a special constant \f(CW\*(C`UNTOUCHED\*(C'\fR:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&   Spawn (['ls', @files], stdout => 'ls.log', stderr => UNTOUCHED);
.Ve
will redirect the child's stdout, but leave its stderr alone\-\-\-so it
will wind up on the stderr of your program.
.PP
Finally, if you want to force \f(CW\*(C`Spawn\*(C'\fR to merge stderr with stdout, a
second special constant, \f(CW\*(C`MERGE\*(C'\fR, is provided:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&   Spawn (['ls', @files], stdout => \e@output, stderr => MERGE);
.Ve
will cause the child's stdout and stderr both to be captured to the
\&\f(CW\*(C`@output\*(C'\fR array.  Due to the mercurial nature of output buffering, it
is unwise to make any assumptions about the order of error and output
messages in this array.  In fact, this sort of trickery is generally
unwise in any case, because of the danger that the end user will never
see some error messages at all\-\-\-almost always a situation to be
avoided.  It's usually best just to leave the child's stderr alone (or
let \f(CW\*(C`Spawn\*(C'\fR merge it into a stdout log file), to maximize the end
user's chance of seeing his error messages.
.SH "INTERFACE TO MNI::STARTUP"
.IX Header "INTERFACE TO MNI::STARTUP"
Apart from the trickery involved in setting default values for the
\&\f(CW\*(C`verbose\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`execute\*(C'\fR options, \fI\s-1MNI:\s0:Spawn\fR has another possible
interaction with the \fI\s-1MNI:\s0:Startup\fR module.  To make things
interesting, however, this is an interaction with \fI\s-1MNI:\s0:Startup\fR\-\-\-in
particular, the \f(CW\*(C`self_announce\*(C'\fR subroutine\-\-\-in child programs spawned
by \f(CW\*(C`Spawn\*(C'\fR.
.PP
In particular, \f(CW\*(C`Spawn\*(C'\fR decides whether the child ought to announce its
arguments (and other details of its execution environment) to the world.
Normally, when a program's output is being logged to a file, it should
make such an announcement.  However, if \f(CW\*(C`Spawn\*(C'\fR's \f(CW\*(C`verbose\*(C'\fR option is
true, it will have already done so.  If the child program's output is
not being redirected\-\-\-i.e. it will wind up in the same place as its
parent's output, including \f(CW\*(C`Spawn\*(C'\fR's verbosities\-\-\-then having the
child print its command line would be redundant and contribute needless
clutter to the parent's log file.  Thus, in that case, \f(CW\*(C`Spawn\*(C'\fR sets the
environment variable \f(CW\*(C`suppress_announce\*(C'\fR to true.  (It also sets the
environment variable if the child's output is being captured; in that
case, you probably don't want to have to filter out the excess lines in
the capture variable.)
.PP
It is then the responsibility of \f(CW\*(C`MNI::Startup::self_announce\*(C'\fR in the
child program to check the value of \f(CW\*(C`suppress_announce\*(C'\fR and act
appropriately.  See the MNI::Startup manpage for details of that side of the
conspiracy.
.SH "ERROR HANDLING"
.IX Header "ERROR HANDLING"
Paying attention to the failure of a child program is an important
aspect of writing robust programs.  In the shell (or Perl, just using
\&\f(CW\*(C`system\*(C'\fR), this is a pain\-\-\-you have to check \f(CW\*(C`$?\*(C'\fR (or \f(CW\*(C`system\*(C'\fR's
return value) after every single invocation of an external program, e.g.
.PP
.Vb 2
\&   system ("ls", @files)          && die "ls failed\en";
\&   system ("cp", @files, $newdir) && die "cp failed\en";
.Ve
(Note that since \f(CW\*(C`system\*(C'\fR just returns the child's termination status,
non-zero indicates failure.)
.PP
The most obvious solution to this is to write a toy subroutine that does
the check for you:
.PP
.Vb 3
\&   sub execute
\&   {
\&      my @cmd = @_;
.Ve
.Vb 2
\&      system (@cmd) && die "$cmd[0] failed\en";
\&   }
.Ve
\&\fI\s-1MNI:\s0:Spawn\fR in fact grew out of just such a subroutine, with a few
features added here and there.  The main advantage \fI\s-1MNI:\s0:Spawn\fR offers
over this simple subroutine (for error handling, at least) is the
customizable response to a child program's failure or abnormal
termination.
.PP
First, a child is deemed to have crashed any time its termination status is
non-zero.  The \fItermination status\fR is the 16\-bit word provided by the
\&\f(CW\*(C`wait()\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`waitpid()\*(C'\fR system calls, and made available in Perl through
the \f(CW\*(C`$?\*(C'\fR special variable.  It encapsulates both the exit status\-\-\-which
is passed by a program to \f(CW\*(C`exit()\*(C'\fR in the case of normal termination\-\-\-and
the signal number responsible for a program's abnormal termination (if
any).  Currently, \fI\s-1MNI:\s0:Spawn\fR treats any non-zero termination status the
same: the child program is deemed to have \*(L"crashed\*(R".
.PP
When such a crash is detected, \f(CW\*(C`Spawn\*(C'\fR takes its directions from the
\&\f(CW\*(C`err_action\*(C'\fR option.  Currently the following values are supported:
.Ip "\f(CW\*(C`'fatal'\*(C'\fR (default)" 4
.IX Item "'fatal' (default)"
\&\f(CW\*(C`Spawn\*(C'\fR will \f(CW\*(C`die\*(C'\fR (with a useful error message giving the name of
your program, the sub-program that crashed, and its termination status)
whenever a child program crashes.
.Ip "\f(CW\*(C`'notify'\*(C'\fR" 4
.IX Item "'notify'"
\&\f(CW\*(C`Spawn\*(C'\fR will mail a detailed description of the child program's crash, and
then \f(CW\*(C`die\*(C'\fR just like \f(CW\*(C`'fatal'\*(C'\fR.  The recipient of the mail is specified
by the \f(CW\*(C`notify\*(C'\fR option, which defaults to \f(CW\*(C`$ENV{'USER'}\*(C'\fR; if \f(CW\*(C`notify\*(C'\fR is
false (e.g. empty or undefined), or if \f(CW\*(C`execute\*(C'\fR is false, then the mail
is not sent.
.Ip "\f(CW\*(C`'warn'\*(C'\fR" 4
.IX Item "'warn'"
\&\f(CW\*(C`Spawn\*(C'\fR will print a warning message and return the child's termination
status to its caller.
.Ip "\f(CW\*(C`'ignore'\*(C'\fR" 4
.IX Item "'ignore'"
\&\f(CW\*(C`Spawn\*(C'\fR will simply return the child's termination status to its caller
without printing any warning message.
.Ip "\f(CW\*(C`''\*(C'\fR (\fIempty string\fR or undefined)" 4
.IX Item "'' (empty string or undefined)"
The same as \f(CW\*(C`'warn'\*(C'\fR for backwards compatibility.  (This was the default
in previous incarnations of \fI\s-1MNI:\s0:Spawn\fR.)
.Ip "\fIany other non-empty string\fR" 4
.IX Item "any other non-empty string"
The string is \f(CW\*(C`eval\*(C'\fR'd as Perl code in the package of \f(CW\*(C`Spawn\*(C'\fR's
caller.  If you have a regular and consistent need for this hack, err
feature, please let me know\-\-\-it's probably something that should be
added to the list of \*(L"magic keywords\*(R".  You should avoid using code that
consists solely of a string of lowercase letters and underscores, as I
reserve that for future \*(L"magic keywords\*(R" (like \f(CW\*(C`'fatal'\*(C'\fR).
.PP
Note that \f(CW\*(C`Spawn\*(C'\fR returns the termination status (assuming it returns at
all), so if it doesn't crash your program you can still detect failed
executions.
.SH "CONVENTIONAL INTERFACE"
.IX Header "CONVENTIONAL INTERFACE"
The subroutines provided by the conventional interface are:
.Ip "SetOptions (\s-1OPTION\s0, \s-1VALUE\s0, ...)" 4
.IX Item "SetOptions (OPTION, VALUE, ...)"
Sets one or more module options.  Croaks if any \s-1OPTION\s0 argument is not one
of the known options, or if you don't supply an even number of arguments.
See the section on "OPTIONS" for brief descriptions of all the options; complete
details are scattered throughout the relevant sections of this man page.
.Ip "RegisterPrograms (\s-1PROGRAMS\s0 [, \s-1PATH\s0])" 4
.IX Item "RegisterPrograms (PROGRAMS [, PATH])"
Tells \fI\s-1MNI:\s0:Spawn\fR about the programs you intend to run during the
lifetime of your program.  \s-1PROGRAMS\s0 must be a reference to either a list
or a hash; \s-1PATH\s0, if it is given, must be either a reference to a list of
directories or a string containing colon-separated directories.  If \s-1PATH\s0
is not given, the \f(CW\*(C`search_path\*(C'\fR option is used (which in turn
effectively defaults to \f(CW\*(C`$ENV{'PATH'}\*(C'\fR).
.Sp
If \s-1PROGRAMS\s0 is a list reference, the list in question should be of bare
program names (no directory components).  Each program listed in
\&\s-1PROGRAMS\s0 is searched for in the directories listed in \s-1PATH\s0 (or
\&\f(CW\*(C`search_path\*(C'\fR, or \f(CW\*(C`$ENV{'PATH'}\*(C'\fR); if any are not found, an
appropriate error message (e.g. 'Couldn't find program \*(L"foo\*(R"') is
printed for each missing program and \f(CW\*(C`RegisterPrograms\*(C'\fR returns false.
In the event of such a failure, any successful search results are \fInot\fR
kept\-\-\-this should almost always be treated as a fatal error, so
\&\fI\s-1MNI:\s0:Spawn\fR doesn't expect that you'll continue marching blithely on.
Only if all programs listed in \s-1PROGRAMS\s0 are found does
\&\f(CW\*(C`RegisterPrograms\*(C'\fR store the full paths for later use by \f(CW\*(C`Spawn\*(C'\fR (in
the \*(L"command completion\*(R" phase); it then returns true.  Thus, this is
usually called like
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&   RegisterPrograms ([qw(ls rm cat cp)]) || exit 1;
.Ve
where we don't print an error message because \f(CW\*(C`RegisterPrograms\*(C'\fR takes care
of it for us.
.Sp
If \s-1PROGRAMS\s0 is a hash reference, the keys of the hash must be program
names, and the values must be full paths to the executable file that you
want to run when \f(CW\*(C`Spawn\*(C'\fR is passed the corresponding program name.  For
instance, you might wish to force \f(CW\*(C`Spawn\*(C'\fR to run \f(CW\*(C`gtar\*(C'\fR in place of
\&\f(CW\*(C`tar\*(C'\fR.  This could be accomplished as follows:
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&   $gtar = MNI::FileUtilities::find_program ('gtar');
\&   RegisterPrograms ({ tar => $gtar }) || exit 1;
.Ve
Later on, you might have the following:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&   Spawn (['tar', $taropts, $tarfile, $dir]);
.Ve
in which case \f(CW\*(C`Spawn\*(C'\fR would actually run \f(CW\*(C`gtar\*(C'\fR (or, more accurately,
the \f(CW\*(C`gtar\*(C'\fR found by \f(CW\*(C`MNI::FileUtilities::find_program\*(C'\fR).
.Sp
\&\f(CW\*(C`RegisterPrograms\*(C'\fR can be called any number of times in your program\-\-\-it
always adds to the existing list of \*(L"known programs\*(R", and silently
overrides any programs you previously registered.
.Sp
See also \f(CW\*(C`find_programs\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`find_program\*(C'\fR, and \f(CW\*(C`search_directories\*(C'\fR in
the MNI::FileUtilities manpage.
.Ip "AddDefaultArgs (\s-1PROGRAMS\s0, \s-1ARGS\s0 [, \s-1WHERE\s0])" 4
.IX Item "AddDefaultArgs (PROGRAMS, ARGS [, WHERE])"
Adds to one of the default argument lists for one or more programs.
\&\s-1PROGRAMS\s0 can be either a string (the name of a single program) or an
array reference (list of several programs); in the latter case, the same
arguments will be added to the default argument list for each listed
program.  \s-1ARGS\s0 may be a single argument (a string), or a reference to a
list of arguments.  \s-1WHERE\s0, if given, must be either \f(CW\*(C`'pre'\*(C'\fR or
\&\f(CW\*(C`'post'\*(C'\fR\-\-\-it tells which of the two default argument lists we should
add \s-1ARGS\s0 to, i.e. where in the argument list these arguments should be
added when it comes to \*(L"command completion\*(R" time in \f(CW\*(C`Spawn\*(C'\fR.  It
defaults to \f(CW\*(C`'pre'\*(C'\fR.
.Sp
This is most useful if you have a flag in your program that you wish to
propagate (via command line options) to other programs.  For instance,
you might wish to have a \f(CW\*(C`$Verbose\*(C'\fR flag determine the presence of
\&\f(CW\*(C`\-quiet\*(C'\fR on the command lines of various sub-programs:
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&   AddDefaultArgs ([qw(mincresample mincreshape mincmath)], '-quiet')
\&      unless $Verbose;
.Ve
.Ip "ClearDefaultArgs (\s-1PROGRAMS\s0 [, \s-1WHERE\s0])" 4
.IX Item "ClearDefaultArgs (PROGRAMS [, WHERE])"
Clears one or both of the default argument lists for one or more
programs.  Like with \f(CW\*(C`AddDefaultArgs\*(C'\fR, \s-1PROGRAMS\s0 may be a single program
(a string) or a reference to a list of programs.  \s-1WHERE\s0, if given, may
be \f(CW\*(C`'pre'\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`'post'\*(C'\fR, or \f(CW\*(C`'both'\*(C'\fR\-\-\-it tells whether to delete the
list of \*(L"pre\*(R" arguments, \*(L"post\*(R" arguments, or both lists.  It defaults
to \f(CW\*(C`both\*(C'\fR.
.Ip "Spawn (\s-1COMMAND\s0 [, \s-1OPTION\s0, \s-1VALUE\s0, ...])" 4
.IX Item "Spawn (COMMAND [, OPTION, VALUE, ...])"
Executes a single command.  (Or, more accurately, \f(CW\*(C`fork\*(C'\fRs and \f(CW\*(C`exec\*(C'\fRs the
command in the child process with appropriate output/error redirection.)
Option/value pairs may be supplied as for \f(CW\*(C`SetOptions\*(C'\fR; they only take
effect for the duration of this \f(CW\*(C`Spawn\*(C'\fR call, though.  \s-1COMMAND\s0 may be a
string or a list ref; if it is a string, the same caveats as for Perl's
\&\f(CW\*(C`system\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`exec\*(C'\fR functions apply\-\-\-namely, that the presence of shell
metacharacters in your command string means it will be processed by
\&\f(CW\*(C`/bin/sh\*(C'\fR; otherwise, it will be handled directly by Perl.  For this
reason, it is best to stick to the \*(L"command as list\*(R" paradigm; most uses
for shell metacharacters can be better done within Perl, either using
standard Perl features or \fI\s-1MNI:\s0:Spawn\fR's redirection/capture feature.  For
example, you can replace any shell globbing pattern with \f(CW\*(C`opendir\*(C'\fR,
\&\f(CW\*(C`readdir\*(C'\fR, and \f(CW\*(C`grep\*(C'\fR (and use Perl's more powerful regular expression
engine); most pipelines involving standard Unix utilities like \f(CW\*(C`grep\*(C'\fR,
\&\f(CW\*(C`sed\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`awk\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`cut\*(C'\fR, etc. are easily and more efficiently implemented
directly in Perl; and, of course, \f(CW\*(C`Spawn\*(C'\fR can do output redirection or
capturing for you.
.Sp
Returns the program's termination status (this is the 16\-bit word supplied
by \f(CW\*(C`waitpid(2)\*(C'\fR that includes both the program's exit status and the
signal that killed it, if any).  If we couldn't even run the program,
returns a made-up non-zero termination status (\f(CW\*(C`255 >> 8\*(C'\fR, for
what it's worth).  Thus, any non-zero return value implies failure.  Thus,
an alternative to setting the \f(CW\*(C`err_action\*(C'\fR option to \f(CW\*(C`'fatal'\*(C'\fR is:
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&   MNI::Spawn::SetOptions (err_action => 'ignore');   # or 'warn'
\&   Spawn ($cmd) && die "$cmd failed\en";
.Ve
Complete details of \f(CW\*(C`Spawn\*(C'\fR's operation are given in 
the section on "COMMAND COMPLETION", the section on "INTERFACE TO BATCH",
the section on "REDIRECTION AND CAPTURING", and the section on "ERROR HANDLING" above.
