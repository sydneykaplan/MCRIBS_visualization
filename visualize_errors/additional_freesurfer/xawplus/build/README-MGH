xawplus-3.1.0-MGH.tar.gz contains a modified version of the
source bundle called xawplus-3.1.0.tgz that is distributed
from the web site: http://people.freenet.de/kra/XawPlus/

Modifications were made to compile the code under gcc 4.0, 
which is very picky with its warnings and errors (things 
like unitialized vars and missing indent bracing).  
The mods should not affect runtime operation.

Also, the makefile was modified to build only the static
libs, and to install in a directory one above the source
directory.

So, at the NMR Center, this is the install procedure:

  cd /usr/pubsw/packages/xawplus
  mkdir 3.1.0
  ln -s 3.1.0 current
  cd current
  tar zxvf xawplus-3.1.0-MGH.tar.gz
  ln -s XawPlus-MGH src
  cd src
  make
  make install
